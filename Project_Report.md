  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Main/>,
    loader: mainLoader,
    errorElement: <Error/>,
    children: [
      {
        index: true,
        path: "/",
        element: <Dashboard/>,
        loader: dashboardLoader,
        action: dashboardAction,
        errorElement: <Error/>
      },
      {
        path: "budget/:id",
        element: <BudgetPage/>,
        loader: budgetLoader,
        action: budgetAction,
        errorElement: <Error/>,
        children: [
          { path: "delete", action: deleteBudget }
        ]
      },
      {
        path: "expenses",
        element: <ExpensesPage/>,
        loader: expensesLoader,
        action: expensesAction,
        errorElement: <Error/>
      },
      {
        path: "/logout",
        action: logoutAction,
        errorElement: <Error/>
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <h1>About</h1>,
        errorElement: <Error/>
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    path: "*",
    errorElement: <Error/>
  }
]);
```
